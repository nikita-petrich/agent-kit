# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest published version of `agentkit-blueprint`.
Before reporting a problem, confirm it still exists after updating:

```bash
npx agentkit-blueprint@latest update
```

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use the repository's private vulnerability reporting form under **Security**,
then **Advisories**, then **Report a vulnerability**. Include:

- the affected version
- the operating system and Node.js version
- the affected adapter or installer command
- clear reproduction steps
- the expected impact
- a suggested fix, if you have one

Remove API keys, tokens, credentials, personal data, and private repository
content from every report and attachment.

You should receive an initial response within seven days. Confirmed issues will
be assessed, fixed in a private fork when appropriate, and disclosed after a
patched version is available.
